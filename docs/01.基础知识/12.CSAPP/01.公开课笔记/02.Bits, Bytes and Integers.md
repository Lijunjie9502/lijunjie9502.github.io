## Representing information as bits

### Everything is bits

### Encoding Byte Values

## Bit-level manipulations

### Boolean Algebra

### Bit-Level Operations in C

### Logic Operations in C

### Shift Operations

:::tip Undefined Behavior
* shift amount < 0 or >= word size
:::

## Integers

### Representation: unsigned and signed

#### Encoding integers

#### Numeric Ranges

#### Values for Different Word Sizes

#### Mapping Between Signed & Unsigned

:::warning Keep bit representations and reinterpret
:::

#### Sign Extension

#### Truncation

## Unsigned Addition

## Integer Addition

## Multiplication

## Power-of-2 Multiply with Shift
